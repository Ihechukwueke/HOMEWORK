Even the way events are captured in GA4 is different from UA (there's no longer a need for your event categories, actions, and labels).

As Ash puts it:","“We’ll welcome a new member to the team next Spring, the advantage being that we would’ve got to know that person over the previous 6 months, and they would’ve got to know us. It feels like wins all round”.","Black Codher’s competitive selection process sees 50 people chosen from around 300 applicants. The comprehensive 6 month programme entails 2 evenings of contact time and 10 hours of self-directed learning a week, so we know whoever joins us next year will be a brilliant addition to the team.","recruitment-is-a-process-of-incremental-change","Recruitment is a process of incremental change","outline-of-the-changes-substrakt-has-made-to-their-recruitment-process-written-about-in-further-detail","affecting-change-to-language-and-behaviours-internally-which-can-be-an-even-greater-communications-and-culture-challenge-for-larger-organisations","Affecting change to language and behaviours internally (which can be an even greater communications and culture challenge for larger organisations)","language-and-tone---beyond-just-the-job-advert-itself","Language and tone - beyond just the job advert itself","the-importance-of-communicating-workplace-culture","The importance of communicating workplace culture","redacting-information-from-job-adverts","Redacting information from job adverts ","collection-and-use-of-demographic-data","Collection and use of demographic data ","establishing-kpis","Establishing KPIs ","the-challenges-around-seasonal-recruitment","The challenges around seasonal recruitment ","12 minutes","Caspian","what-is-accessibility","What is accessibility?","content","Content","who-is-accessibility-for","Who is accessibility for?","temporary-situational-and-permanent","Temporary, Situational and Permanent","why-do-i-need-to-make-my-website-accessible","Why do I need to make my website accessible?","how-can-i-ensure-my-website-is-accessible","How can I ensure my website is accessible?","conclusion","Conclusion","resources-and-further-reading","Resources and further reading","accessible-content","Accessible Content","tools","Tools","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002FWAI\u002Fbusiness-case\u002F","2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","so-what-is-sustainable-web-design","So, what is sustainable web design?","calculating-your-websites-carbon-footprint","Calculating your website’s carbon footprint","so-how-do-we-measure-this","So how do we measure this?","what-can-we-do-about-it","What can we do about it?","making-your-website-more-efficient-will-benefit-everyone","Making your website more efficient will benefit everyone","final-thoughts","Final thoughts","11 minutes","Ash","reaching-more-people-and-welcoming-them","Reaching more people, and welcoming them","dont-do-the-same-things-and-expect-different-results","Don’t do the same things and expect different results","words-are-important","Words are important","process-is-key","Process is key","diverse-voices","Diverse voices","cumulative-and-ongoing","Cumulative and ongoing","tldr--useful-reading","TL;DR & Useful reading","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.beapplied.com\u002Fpost\u002Fgender-bias-in-hiring-report","https:\u002F\u002Fgender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk\u002Factions-to-close-the-gap\u002Feffective-actions","https:\u002F\u002Fwol.iza.org\u002Farticles\u002Fanonymous-job-applications-and-hiring-discrimination\u002Flong","Stu","requirements","Requirements","pipelineconfiguration","Pipeline configuration","testing-thepipeline","Testing the pipeline","testing-the-pipelineslocally","Testing the pipelines locally","installationinstructions","Installation instructions","conclusion-and-furtherreading","Conclusion and further reading","furtherreading","Further reading","https:\u002F\u002Fgitlab.com\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.docker.com\u002Fget-started","Docker","https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.gitlab.com\u002Frunner\u002F",".gitlab-ci.yml","test_app","script","case-study-1-instant-access-to-members-only-events","Case study 1: instant access to members-only events","case-study-2-exclusive-content-for-members","Case study 2: exclusive content for members","smartlinks---smart-extras","SmartLinks - Smart extras","get-in-touch","Get in touch","Technical SEO Tasks","\u002Fjournal\u002Fseo-keeping-content-customer-centric","Topic Clusters","not","get in touch","https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fsubstrakt","the-ongoing-tasks","The Ongoing Tasks","how-do-i-start","How do I start?","how-often-should-i-complete-ongoing-seo-tasks","How often should I complete ongoing SEO tasks?","Five 5-minute SEO tasks","the-five-tasks","The Five Tasks","1-search-console-setup","1.
